## Context:
Data Analyst Duo is an instagram community (@𝒅𝒂𝒕𝒂𝒂𝒏𝒂𝒍𝒚𝒔𝒕𝒅𝒖𝒐) of ~𝟕𝟓𝐤 data enthusiasts founded by two individuals Aditi & Kalpesh. They share content around statistics, data science & analytics with budding data aspirants.
**Domain: Social Media**

**Data:** 
dataanalystduo instagram analytics copy1.xlsx- : The data set contains stats about the channel (@𝒅𝒂𝒕𝒂𝒂𝒏𝒂𝒍𝒚𝒔𝒕𝒅𝒖𝒐)

**Data Dictionary:**
- Date: Date
- Instagram reach: The number of unique accounts that saw any of your posts or stories at least once. Reach is different from impressions, which may include multiple views of your posts by the same accounts. This metric is estimated.
- Instagram profile visits: The number of times your profile was visited.
- New Instagram followers: The number of new accounts that started following your Instagram account.
- Title: Title of the post
- Post type: Type of post - IG video, IG carousel, IG Image
- Impressions: The number of times your post was viewed
- Reach: The number of accounts your post was reached
- Shares: The number of times you post was shared
- Follows: The number of new accounts that started following your Instagram account.
- Likes: The number of likes on the post
- Comments: The number of comments on the post
- Saves: The number of saves on the post

### Project Objective
The goal is to analyse the data and provide recommendations on what type of post are working for the page.

- Dataset is owned by @dataanalystduo page & instagram.

## Actions
I’ve collected the data from the instagram page “dataanalystduo”.

I’ve performed data clearning i.e removing incorrect or irrelevant data on the dataset and analyzed unique counts of values present in each column or field of the dataset to get an understanding of how the data looks like.

Performed Exploratory Data Analysis on the dataset i.e using line charts to see the trends/patters in the columns like “Instagram Reach”, “Instagram Profile Visits”, “Instagram New Followers” and used pivot tables along with aggregate functions to see the average shares, reach, impressions, New followers, comments and saves followed by the counts of title for each of posts which includes IG Videos, Images and Carousel per day.

Finally we compared the averages and counts of each column with respect to the types of posts such as IG Videos, IG Images and IG Carousel to provide recommendation of what type of post should the duo opt for.

## Results
After analyzing the findings, it is found that IG Videos have worked well for the page “datanalystduo” in gaining New Followers and also IG Carousel for engaging the current audience of the page.

## Growth/Next Steps
Social media feeds (specifically what people/posts you see when you log on) are driven by an algorithm but these can change from time to time. For example, on LinkedIn, there was a time when polls got a huge amount of reach, then it became sharing PDF documents. The algorithm was being changed behind the scenes to up-weight or down-weight certain types of post type.

As of now IG videos/reels, act as better engagement widely in general.

In future, there might be possibilities that they may change the algorithm to favor image posts or some newly discovered post type which can act as better engagement for the users

So keeping this analysis up to date would help the user keep close to what was working now rather than what worked several months ago.

Also, diving deeper into IG videos to understand which topics got the most traction helps the duo in creating more content towards those topics.

### Key learning after this project:
- Data cleaning is the process of identifying and correcting or removing errors, inconsistencies, and inaccuracies in a dataset.
- Observation writing involves examining the data and noting any notable findings, anomalies, or areas of interest.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is the process of examining and visualizing a dataset to understand its main characteristics, such as the distribution of data, the relationships between variables, and any anomalies or patterns that may exist. The goal of EDA is to uncover insights and trends that can help inform further analysis or decision-making. It is often the first step in any data analysis project, as it provides a foundation for more advanced statistical methods and models.
